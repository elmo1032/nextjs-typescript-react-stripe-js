 Here are the bugs in the code you provided:

1. The public Stripe publishable key contains a typo in the variable name: `NEXT_PUBL,IC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` should be `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
2. The secret Stripe key has a comma in the middle of the variable name: `STRI,PE_SECRET_KEY` should be `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
3. The Stripe webhook secret also has an extra comma in the middle of the variable name: `STRIPE_WEB,HOOK_SECRET` should be `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
4. There are extra commas at the end of the lines for the secret key and the webhook secret, which will cause a syntax error.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Stripe API keys configuration

# Public key, for client-side payment processing
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "pk_12345"

# Secret key for server-side payment processing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "sk_12345"

# Webhook signing secret for verifying event payloads
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "whsec_12345"
```
