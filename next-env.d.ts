 Here are the bugs in the provided code:

1. There is a syntax error on the first line. The closing ">" of the comment is missing.
2. The second line is a duplicate of the first line. It should be removed.
3. There is a typo in the word "types" in both lines. It should be "types" instead of "ty,pe".
4. The reference to "next" should only be included once, either in the first line or the second line, but not both.
5. There is a comma at the end of the second line, which is not necessary and should be removed.

Here is the corrected code:

<`<reference types="next" />`>

<`reference types="next" />` // remove this line

<`/reference types="next"`> // typo fixed

<`/`> // remove the comma
